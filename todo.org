* Making Music from censors
Music is to a great extend an event-based phenomenon. SpigetOfMusic transforms Censor-Generated transient numbers to the product type (Pitch, Duration)
SpigetOfMusic is a sensor to music transducer!
** Detail
*** These computation will be performed in parallel
**** Pitch computation
***** compute Radix22(\pi{}) * Radix22(sensor-generated number)
****** convert to modular 12 ??
**** Duration computation
***** compute Radix22(e) * Radix22(sensor-generated number)
****** convert to modular 12 ??
*** Segment 
**** store the computations above as a Segment, Functor
*** Segment Reuse
***** apply Pitch-Shifting to create a new segment
****** segment.map(Pitchshifting-function)
***** apply time-streaching to create a new segment
****** segment.map(duration-function)
**** Segments may overlay. I Haven't put a lot of thought into this yet

** Non-Functional Requirements
*** Use Rholang
*** Deploy to Raspberry Pi
